# Youtube-playlist-maker-using-links
want to make playlist using links/old chats/names use this code

                              *Create an Empty Playlist Before Starting*

Note:- I use stack overflow for login purpose because login direct through google throws an error.

1. Make sure you store txt file in same directory
2. install selenium package
   link :- https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
3. download chromedriver and place in same folder
   link :- https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
4. Enter Filename With extention
5. Enter what your file contains links/names as directed in code
6. Enter username
7. Enter password  #password will not show in terminal/command prompt while typing because that is protected
8. If you acoount is protected with authentication you get 11 second to authenticate
    you can increase time if you want in 
    sleep()


Warning:
if your internet is slow you can increase time in
sleep()
column
